                                                      *Space complexity* 

Generally space complexity is defined as the memory used by the program to execute.
Usually, any programmer aims for fast response and less memory occupancy of the program.

Here, space complexity deals with the memory storage of the program

For example:
main(){
    int array[5]=[1,2,3,4,5];

}
Here the memory storage of int is 4 bytes , but what about array the array value or size is given already so the space complexity of this program is O(1) which is constant size.

For example:
main(){
    int array[n];
}

Here the memory storage of int is 4 bytes but the array size is not decalred as it counts n times so the space complexity of this 4+n, so the order is n so its complexity is O(n).
